## Overview

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project that showcases modern development practices. The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, enhanced by Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for smooth animations. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with secure authentication implemented using JWT. Passwords are securely stored using hashing.


### Functionality:
- **Sign Up / Sign In:** Users can create an account or log in to their existing account using secure JWT authentication.
- **Search User:** Search and view details of other users within the system.
- **Make Payments Online:** Easily send money to other users with a seamless and safe transaction process.
- **Transaction History:** Users can view their transaction history for reference and tracking.
- **Profile Page:** Users can see their profile information.
- **Contact Us Page:** Allows users to reach out for support or inquiries.

### Frontend:
- **React with TypeScript** for robust type checking and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and responsive UI development.
- **Framer Motion** for dynamic animations.

### Backend:
- **Node.js with Express** for API creation.
- **JWT** for secure user authentication.
- **Password hashing** for enhanced security.
- **Zod** for schema validation.
- **MongoDB** for storing data
